# Wind-Turbine-Analysis
My ongoing project of a wind turbine SCADA data.
------------------------------------------------

#Data:

From https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psycon/wind-turbine-energy-kw-generation-data
Many thanks for publishing it to: Batucan Senkal - https://www.kaggle.com/psycon

I start with the "features.csv"
This set has:
Rows: 154.262
Columns: 77
Size: 146,3 MiB

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Scenario:

I'm  a technician for wind turbines and just finished my Google Data Analytics Course.\
As I want to enter the field of data analytics, I thougt, this might be a good idea to do an
analysis of a wind turbine. I found this dataaset on Kaggle, this is NOT from any of my employer's turbines.\
\
My scope is on main bearing temperature, generator temperature and power production\
\
Here I'd like to describe the process of this analysis.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Tools:

I'm using Libre Office Calc (spreadsheets)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Cleaning:

First thing I did, was to use the statistics tool for descriptive statistics to get a first overview.

Min and Max are -273 and 99999. Tis is the same for other temperature variables.
Power outage, shortcurcits or open wires can cause this issiues.\

Set a filter and recheck.
