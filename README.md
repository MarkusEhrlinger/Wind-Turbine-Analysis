# Wind-Turbine-Analysis
My ongoing project of a wind turbine SCADA data.
------------------------------------------------

#DATA: 
From https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psycon/wind-turbine-energy-kw-generation-data
Many thanks for publishing it to: Batucan Senkal - https://www.kaggle.com/psycon

I start with the "features.csv"
This set has:
Rows: 154.262
Columns: 77

#Scenario
I'm  a technician for wind turbines and just finished my Google Data Analytics Course.
As I want to enter the field of data analytics, I thougt, this might be a good idea to do an
analysis of a wind turbine. I found this dataaset on Kaggle, this is NOT from any of my employer's turbines.

My scope is on main bearing temperature, generator temperature and power production

Here I'd like to describe the process of this analysis.

#Tools
I'm using Libre Office Calc (spreadsheets)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Cleaning
First thing I did, was to use the statistics tool for descriptive statistics to get a first overview.
